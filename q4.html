  Preformatted text is text that is displayed with a specific layout, preserving both spaces and line breaks as they were written in the code or markdown. This can be achieved by using the <pre> HTML tag, a monospace font in a word processing or text editing program, or by indenting the text with multiple whitespaces in markdown.
